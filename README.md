# Skillsync
Skillsync is a college level mobile application for communication about ongoing academic or technical events.
</br>
</br>
Our mobile app streamlines communication       
   between college faculty and students, 
   serving as a centralized platform for 
   hackathons, workshops, presentations, 
   certification courses, and internships. 
</br>

   Faculty effortlessly post event details, while 
   students can access and register. 
   </br>
   Timely 
   reminders and an organized system 
   enhance engagement, fostering a 
   connected academic community, 
   empowering students in skill-building and 
   professional development.
